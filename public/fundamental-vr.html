	<p>SanaCareVR is a VR simulation for nurses to train them in sterile surgical procedures. This was a multiplayer gamified simulation which involved gauze counting and sterile activity.
		I was mainly responsible for the main UI. Through this UI the user was able to proceed through the activity and submit answers which was then assessed and uploaded to the fundamental surgery platform. 
		I also ensured the performance for this application met app lab standards which was 60+ fps.
